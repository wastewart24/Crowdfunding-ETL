# Crowdfunding-ETL
### Summary
The company, Independent Funding, has just received a new dataset that contains information about the backers who’ve pledged to live projects. They wants you to perform both an ETL process on this dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries.

I used Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. Specifically, I extracted and transformed the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file. I then did the load phase. This required use of the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. And, I uploaded the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. Finally, I performed a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.

The database for this project has the following schema seen below:
